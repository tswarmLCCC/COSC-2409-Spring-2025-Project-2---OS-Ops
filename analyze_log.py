    **Instructions:**
    1. Complete the `extract_log_data` function to extract timestamp, IP address, URL, and status code from each valid log line.
    2. (Optional) Implement the `count_status_codes` function to count occurrences of each status code.

    This function opens the log file, reads each line, and performs analysis based on the extracted data.

    # b.  inside this loop, first extract the log data using the extract_log_data function or the regular expression given in the instructions.
    # c.  if the data is extracted successfully, update the error count, unique IPs, and URL counts.
    #     - if the ip is not in your unique_ips set, add it to the set.
    #     - if the url is in your url_counts dictionary, increment the count by 1, otherise add the url to the dictionary with a count of 1.
    #     - if the status code is greater than or equal to 400, increment the error count by 1.

    """Extracts timestamp, IP address, URL, and status code from a valid log line.

    **Instructions:**
    1. Use regular expressions (re module) to extract the data from the log line format:
       - Timestamp (YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS)
       - IP address (e.g., 192.168.1.1)
       - URL (everything after "GET ")
       - Status code (e.g., 200, 404)
    2. Return a tuple containing the extracted data (timestamp, ip, url, status_code)
    3. If the line format is invalid, return None for all data points.

    **Example Regular Expression:**
    ```python
    match = re.search(r"\d{4}-\d{2}-\d{2} \d{2}:\d{2}:\d{2} - \d{1,3}\.\d{1,3}\.\d{1,3}\.\d{1,3} - \"GET (.+) HTTP/1.1\" (\d+)", line)
